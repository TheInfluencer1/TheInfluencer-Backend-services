## Microservices
### Authentication Service (`auth-service`)
- Handles JWT-based authentication.
- Supports user registration, login, and password reset.

### User Service (`user-service`)
- Manages user profiles and roles.

### Admin Service (`admin-service`)
- Provides administrative tools and moderation capabilities.

---

## Docker Compose Setup
This project uses Docker Compose to manage microservices.

### **Run All Services**
```sh
docker-compose up --build -d
```

### **Check Running Containers**
```sh
docker ps
```

### **Stop Services**
```sh
docker-compose down
```

---

## Environment Variables (`.env`)
Each microservice has its own `.env` file. Example for `auth-service`:
```env
PORT=5001
MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongodb:27017/influencerDB
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
```

---

## Best Practices
- Use `.env` files for sensitive credentials.
- Follow the MVC pattern for service organization.
- Implement JWT-based authentication for security.
- Use Docker Compose for containerized deployments.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Implement an API Gateway for unified access.
- Add Redis caching for performance optimization.
- Deploy using Kubernetes for better scalability.

---

## Conclusion
This repository provides a structured microservices-based architecture for "The Influencer Backend." The setup ensures modularity, maintainability, and scalability. Contributions and improvements are welcome!
